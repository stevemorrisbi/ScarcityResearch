# Scarcity Research Project

### Overview: This dashboard showcases how Topps' implementation of item scarcity has impacted its total sales.

Parralel cards are printed to numbers of 1, 10 and 99 with a colour variation for each. These parralel cards are randomly inserted into orders.

The print on demand cards can be pruchased at the following prices -
* 1 card = £8
* 5 cards = £24
* 10 cards = £40
* 20 cards = £65

To calculate the average cost of a card assuming the total purchased cards come from the above categories in equal measure = £137 (total price of catergories) ÷ 36 (total number of cards) = £3.80 average card price.

* Total print run for all orders = 444,268 cards
* Total print run with the chance of getting a parralel = 256,382 cards
* Difference between total print run base and parralel option = 187,886 cards (total just base card orders)

To discover the extra ordering caused by parralel cards, the total of just base card orders had to be taken away from the total print run with the chance of getting a parralel = 68,496 extra cards were purchased.

To calculate the average spend on parralel card opportunities, the average of the parralel card orders (9,160) had to be multiplied by the average card price as calaculated above (£3.80). This highlighted that the average spend for parralels was £34,808 and ( avg just base orders 3,080 x £3.80) leaving an avg order total for base of £11,704.

Taking the total spend on avg base order spend from the parralel spend left and avg difference of £23,104 for total orders. 
It was important to highlght this in the centre of the dashboard as a concluding point from the study. 

Slicers were also added to allow the viewer to see the influence of the driver featured on each card. It can be concluded that this had an influence total sales on individual cards and therefore may influence decisions on future production.

### Ideas for future work -
This project could be developed to see if the implementation of scarcity has improved sales amongst other sports also. Sales data for this year would also create an comparison to 2021 to see if there is any trends over time.
